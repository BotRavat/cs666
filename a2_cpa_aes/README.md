Correlation Power Attack on AES            (Due on: Oct 10, 2025, 11:59)

In this assignment, you have to perform correlation power attack on AES-128 traces and you have to retrieve one particular key byte of 10th round key. The power trace file can be downloaded from:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/16bQYMmOEKKm1uzdQZjz0EhxXyWNmlNf5/view?usp=sharing

The first column in the csv file indicates the plaintext, the second column indicates the ciphertext and rest of the columns indicates the sample points.

In the given link below, I have assigned a key byte to every group. If you have not added your group yet, you can do so and take the next byte.

Group and Key Byte link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1blVMWhdyvsGuSk5C20EYtjMpn_pJlF7Jbcy6FrnZeDY/edit?usp=sharing

Each group has to prepare a document with the detailed procedure of the CPA attack on the particular key byte and have to submit the code also. Please make a zip file with name “AssignmentCPA_ Group_Name.zip”, for e.g. Group 1 will have to submit the zip file renaming it as “AssignmentCPA_ Group_1.zip”. And you have to upload it in helloiitk. From every group, only one person can upload the zip file.


**Important:** The power trace CSV file (~1.9 GB) is **not included in this repository** due to its size.  
To run the CPA scripts, download it from the provided link and save it in:  a2_cpa_aes/data
